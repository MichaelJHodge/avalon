# Avalon

Avalon is a decentralized limit order network built on the Nervos CKB blockchain, providing a seamless and secure peer-to-peer platform. The project leverages libp2p for a robust peer-to-peer networking infrastructure, allowing users to create, share, and fulfill limit orders without relying on a centralized exchange.

## Features

- **P2P Networking:** Utilizes Rust's libp2p to establish a decentralized p2p network of nodes for efficient and direct communication.

- **Order Book Management:** Implements a sophisticated off-chain order book, allowing users to create, propagate, and match limit orders without the need for on-chain transactions.

- **CKB Transactions:** Users can sign partial transactions in CKB and distribute them across the network, providing a flexible and secure method for order creation.

- **Matching Mechanism:** Implements a powerful matching mechanism that allows nodes to match partially filled trades and batch completed trades into larger transactions.
